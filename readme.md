# AI For TIC TAC TOE 

In this project i first made a game using pygame and then implemented an AI for tic tac toe game using 3 strategies 
* Random picker 
* Min Max Algorithm
* Alpha Beta Pruning

## Features

- 2 player mode
- Player VS Computer Mode
- Reset button
-toggle button between Modes
player can switch between modes at anytime using the mode button

You play as X and computer plays as O and here computer chooses best move as per our heuristic 'evaluationfunction'

You play as X and computer plays as O and here computer chooses best move as per our heuristic 'evaluationfunction' and
uses alpha beta pruing to reduce search space and give result faster
